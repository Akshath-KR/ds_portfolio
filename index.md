### Employee Retention Prediction
Retaining employees is vital as hiring incurs substantial costs and time. Small businesses spend 40% of working hours on non-income tasks like hiring. Companies allocate 15%-20% of an employee's salary to recruitment, costing an average of $7645. Onboarding consumes 1%-2.5% of total revenue, taking 52 days on average to fill a position. Utilizing predictive models based on factors like Job Involvement, Education, and Job Satisfaction can optimize retention strategies, enhancing workforce stability and productivity. This project is all about predicting employee exit based on certain factors as well as extracting important feature that companies can look after for effective employee retention.

### Telecom Churn Prediction
In the fiercely competitive telecom industry with a 15-25% annual churn rate, retaining high-profit customers is paramount. This project involves analyzing customer data, creating predictive models, and pinpointing key indicators of churn to help telecom companies proactively retain customers, recognizing that retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

### Lead Scoring
The Educational services company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at this company is around 30%. 

This project aims to identify the most potential leads based on their information and interactivity. If the leads are identified successfully, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

### Boom-Bikes
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

This project is all about to model the demand for shared bikes with the available factors, which can be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

### Bank Loan Defaulter

Banks find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants is the aim of this case study.
